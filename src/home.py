    This application provides access to the data presented in the ‚ÄúAcksent: Human Annotated Dataset of Support and Sentiments in Dissertation Acknowledgments‚Äù paper. The article and its accompanying appendix discuss in detail the methodology used to collect and code the data in the dataset.
    The full dataset is also available in .csv format on Zenodo at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13293333](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13293333). Any questions should be directed to [manika@ou.edu](mailto:manika@ou.edu).

    # **Usage**

    The app is divided into four tabs: **Hello (you are here)**, **Qualitative Coding**, **Consensus**, and **Progress Analytics**.

    ## **Qualitative Coding**
    In this tab, users can view the sentences they need to tag. There are options for **Support** and **Sentiment** tags available for each sentence. A note input box is also provided for adding notes to the sentences. Once users complete coding the current part of sentences, they can upload the tagged sentences to Firebase Storage by clicking the **Save** button on the sidebar.

    - The **Skip** button is for sentences where the user is not sure. It will not upload the record to the server and will show the skipped ETD again the next time the user logs in.
    - The **Back** button allows the user to return to the last ETD they just uploaded. If the user finds something they uploaded is incorrect, they can click it multiple times to go back multiple ETDs.

    ## **Consensus**
    In this tab, users can view sentences that were tagged differently by themselves and another team member. A dropdown box is provided to select the **Support** or **Sentiment** coding task. 

    - This page displays sentences labeled differently for each group member, one sentence at a time.
    - Group members can communicate on this page, select the tags they agree on, and upload them to the server using the **Save** button.
    - As with Qualitative Coding, there is a **Back** button to return to the previous step.

    ## **Progress Analytics**
    The Dashboard dynamically displays the user's progress in a task, which is updated in real-time by reading Firebase log records. 

    - This dashboard reads different log files and visualizes the data, which can help users and administrators quickly understand data trends, such as performance in coding tasks.
