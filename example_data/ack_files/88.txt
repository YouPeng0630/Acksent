I would like to heartily thank my thesis advisor Prof. Minh Do for his constant encouragement and guidance. Working with him, I have realized the importance of well-directed enthusiasm, in both research and life. His ability to identify the core intuition and broader vision of complex ideas is something I hope to imbibe. His readiness to collaborate with others has enabled me to gain invaluable exposure to important problems in related areas. I am thankful to Benjamin Chidester for all the advice and support during my first steps into research. His willingness to patiently listen to any idea or problem and provide critical thoughts is an important quality for every researcher. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my collaborators in this project for their valuable contributions: Prof. Jian Ma for advice on genomics; Weizhao Tang for laying the foundations for the work in spatial statistics; Kushagra Tiwary for helping with image processing and detection tasks. I have gained immense knowledge from the courses in the past two years, and would like to thank Prof. Rayadurgam Srikant, Prof. Alex Schwing, Prof. Pierre Moulin, Prof Zhi-Pei Liang and Prof. Bruce Hajek for the same. My teaching assistant role with Prof. Lav Varshney last semester was rewarding, and I am thankful for the experience. This thesis would not have been possible without the assistance of the members of my research group. In particular, I would like to thank Mona Zehni and Khoi Nguyen Mac for all the insightful discussions, Trong Nguyen for providing key tips like ‘add more layers’, and Raymond Yeh and Teck Yian Lim for the short and succinct explanations of advanced concepts. The importance of friends cannot be neglected in any endeavour. I would like to thank Amitha Sandur, Agrima Bansal, Sameer Khan, Abhishek Nar- wekar, Pratik Deogankar, Ishan Deshpande and Konik Kothari for providing
