I thank my mentors, colleagues, and friends, without whom I would not have finished this project. Scott Althaus has been a relentlessly supportive advisor and chair. He is insightful, tough, and thorough, at the same time that he is patient, kind and encouraging. I was fortunate to have someone of his caliber as a guide throughout my time at the University of Illinois. From day one of graduate school, Jim Kuklinski pushed me to think more carefully, read more widely, and write more clearly. Cara Wong asks tough questions that have improved my work immeasurably. Damarys Canache has prompted me to think strategically about framing my work. Each of my committee members allowed me the freedom to pursue my interests outside of political science, for which I will always be grateful. The idea for this project would not have occurred to me were it not for the brilliant, generous staff at the Women’s Resources Center on campus, RACES (Rape, Advocacy, Counseling, and Education Services) and Cognition Works in Urbana, IL. My time at all three of these agencies opened my eyes to the prevalence of trauma, and to its profound implications for how individuals move through the world. I am especially grateful to Molly McLay, Alex Nelson, Rachel Storm, Jaya Kolisetty, Stephanie Ames, Marya Burke, Conrad Hayes, and Debbie Nelson for broadening my horizons. I also thank Sam Clayborn, my co-facilitator at Pathways to Change NC, who cheered me past the finish line. My parents, Bob and Shirley Usry, are my twin pillars, without whom I could not stand. Courtney Patrick has been a steadfast and true friend, with the perspective I often needed. And, Matthew Carter is responsible for getting me out of my head and into the world. Thank you for shooing away my insecurities, even when it seemed like they wouldn’t budge.
