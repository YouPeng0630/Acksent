Over the years I have been privileged to have received a lot of support from many sources for which I am grateful. My advisor, Svetlana Lazebnik, has been instrumental in my growth over the course of my PhD. Several other people have acted as mentors or helped my development including Julia Hockenmaier, Derek Hoiem, Matthew Brown, Stephen Kel- ley, Himanshu Arora, M. Hadi Kiapour, Shuai (Kyle) Zheng, Robinson Piramuthu, David Forsyth, and many others. I appreciate everyoneâ€™s efforts in helping me become a better researcher and working with me over the years. My friends, lab mates, and family have been essential to keeping me sane by offering me another view on a problem or a bit of respite from work: Aditya, Alice, Amanda, Arun, Cara, Charlotte, Chris, Chuhang, Daniel, Daphne, Erin, Fay, Felix, Jason, Jiajun, Joe, Kevin, Kristen, Liwei, Liz, Malia, Mariya, Marilyn, Nikoli, Paige, Pooya, Raj, Robert, Saraubh, Tanmay, Tom, Will, Zhizhong. I would also like to thank the administrative staff in Siebel over the years, who have always made me feel like they were happy to help me however they can.
