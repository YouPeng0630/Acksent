Thank you to my advisor, Dr. Eboni Zamani-Gallaher for your direction, insight, and your direct talk. Your guidance has been invaluable. To my committee members, Drs. Trent, Hood, and Jankowski, thank you for being a part of this process and providing me with the feedback to keep me moving forward. Dr. Trent – thank you for being visibly overjoyed when I told you that I wanted to start the Ph.D. program. It truly made me feel like I belonged. A special thank you to Dr. Frankie Santos Laanan for allowing me to use and modify his Transfer Students’ Questionnaire for this study. Finally, I could not forget to thank Rebecca Miller in the Office for the Protection of Research Subjects for being so amazing (and VERY patient). My family: Thank you to my parents, Paco and Penny Herrera, who asked me why I was going to the community college after graduating high school and accepted the response “well, that is what I am supposed to do now.” I wish you were here to see this, Mom. Thank you to my son, Andrew, with whom I grew up. Making the decision to have you at 17 years old was the hardest and best decision of my life - thank you for changing my life. Thank you to my husband, Scott, for being the best one ever. You have always been an extension of me; picked up where I left off and supported me unconditionally. I can never thank you enough for your constant support. My friends: Thank you to Beth Spark née Kibler for asking me to start taking classes with you – this has been the best. Thank you to all of my friends who provided feedback, listened, and helped me look at things in different ways: especially Joel for talking me off the ledge during my special field qualifying exam. Special thanks also go to my statistics friends, Jennifer, Rebecca, and Wes. Thank you to all of those in my EPS 500 cohort who were spouting theses and referencing frameworks on the first day. I felt so out of my league – thanks for taking me in.
