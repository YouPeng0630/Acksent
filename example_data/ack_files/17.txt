Truth be told the journey to get to this point has been a marvelous one, and I would not have made it without the wonderful help of many of my family members, friends, mentors and colleagues, many of whom are part of more than one category. First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor Lou van den Dries, for his guidance, dedication, and patience. I am very lucky to have been influenced by a person such as him. To my academic siblings for countless hours of reading and meeting for re- search purposes, Elliot Kaplan, Nigel Pynn-Coates, Minh Chieu Tran, and spe- cially Allen Gehret. To the academics and teachers that guided me from the beginning until today, Miss Maria Mercedes, Daniel Sarmiento, Father Francis, Hector Carranza, San- tiago Matallana, Oscar Bernal, Federico Ardila, Alexander Berenstein, Jean Carlos Cortissoz, Alf Onshuus, Monica Winklmeier, April Hoffmeister, Sla- womir Solecki, Rick Laugesen, Scott Ahlgren, Anush Tserunyan and Philipp Hieronymi. To my mom, my dad, my brother, and my grandparents for their unwavering and unconditional love. To my wonderful wife Mariam Bonyadi Camacho, who has been my greatest supporter and the person that stands by me through every moment. To her parents, grandfather, and sister, who have kindly accepted me into their family. To those who brightened up the journey with their presence, Nika, Nero, Juan Pablo Caicedo, Sebastian Sanchez, Ana and Maria Prada, Maria Juliana Rojas, Ana Botero, Sebastian Olano, Federico Castillo, Jose Alejandro Samper, Daniel Rodriguez, Eliana Duarte, Juan Roberto Perilla, Juan Carlos Medina, Juan Camilo Bernal, and Neil Andrews. There are many others that I do not have space to mention but I hold deeply in my heart.
