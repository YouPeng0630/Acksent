I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my adviser Professor Sanjiv Sinha, who gave me the freedom to choose topic I was interested in and guided me through the research work from scratch. I am very fortunate to have learned an eloquent writing and presentation style from him. His advice on personal development and understanding of my situation as an international student have been of tremendous help. This work could not be finished without my collaborators. Special acknowledgements to Dr. Jyothi Sadhu, who helped me begin and pursue successfully a great deal of the project. I would wish to thank Dr. Marc Ghossoub for his constructive criticism and suggestions on improving the rigor of my research . I owe my thanks to Dr. Jun Ma and Krishna Valavala, who taught me cleanroom skills and shared interesting ideas regarding device fabrication. Finally, I want to thank my parents who have been very supportive of my decision to go to a graduate school.
