I would first like to thank my advisor and mentor, Doug Beck, who not only helped me figure out answers, but also raised important questions that have guided my research. I would also like to thank our wonderful friend and col- laborator, Chris Hovde from Southwest Sciences, without his experience and expertise, the work reported here would have been impossible. Researchers from other labs, including Victor Acosta, Phil Hemmer and Dima Budker have also provided valuable input essential for this project. I am ever grateful to my family for their constant encouragement and support throughout my scientific career. It has also taken support from my friends in Illinois and Texas for me to complete seven years of doctoral research - you have my heart-felt gratitude.
