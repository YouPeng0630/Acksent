The completion of this thesis is not possible without the help from many people, thus I would like to briefly express my gratitude towards them in this section. First and foremost, this thesis is not possible without the support and guidance of my advisor, Prof. Dale Van Harlingen, who is not only a great scientist but also a great academic advisor, I felt that I am a better scientist after being trained by him, and I felt fortunate to be able to conduct my thesis research with him. I was always amazed by his ability to see through a set of complicated data and coming up with a simple, obvious, yet beautiful physical story without ould also like to thank all the help that I received from all the DVH group members, including Erik Huemiller, David Hamilton, Kenneth Schlax, and Adam Weis. Specifically, I am deeply indebted to Erik Huemiller, and I have to admit that I learned almost everything about dilution refrigerator and nano-fabrication techniques from him. I want to thank him for voluntarily spending many late-night hours working with me doing wire bonding, loading samples and getting ready for the cool down. I want to thank David for always ready to discuss Josephson junction physics with me. Although I had a short time overlap with Dr. Guang Yue, I have enjoyed a great deal through physics discussion with him. I would also to thank Prof. Seongshik Oh, and his students Dr. Nikesh Koirala, Maryam Salehi at Rutgers University for providing high-quality Bi2Se3 thin films to us. In addition to academic collaborators and colleagues, I want to express my gratitude towards all the staff of MRL, Tao Shang, Fubo Rao, Xiaoli Wang, Mauro Sardela, Scout Maclaren, Kathy Walsh, Rick Hassch, and Steve Burdin, Doug Jeffers, Ernest Northen, for keeping the MRL facilities running, so that I can keep my experiments moving forward, and special thanks to Tony Banks for training me on using the PPMS and the QCE.
