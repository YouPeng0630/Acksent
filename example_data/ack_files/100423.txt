First and foremost, I thank the members of my committee: Richard Sproat, Jennifer Cole, Gary Dell and Cynthia Fisher. This dissertation would not have been possible without their helpful feedback, encouragement, patience and the opportunities they provided. Thanks also go to Gary Linebaugh for recording all the nonsense words I used for my experiments, and Kyle Chambers and Kris Onishi for helping me design the experiments. Finally, I would like to acknowledge that the experiments in this dissertation were a part of the project “The Role of Experience in the Production and Perception of Phonological Sequences” funded by the National Institutes of Health: NIH Grant HD-44458.
