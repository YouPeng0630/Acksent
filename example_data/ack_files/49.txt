I extend my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Hans H. Stein, for giving me the opportunity to expand my horizons in the field of swine nutrition. Thank you for the patience, guidance, and encouragement you have given me. It is an honor to be part of the Stein Monogastric Nutrition Laboratory and I could not have asked for a better graduate school experience. You have been a good mentor and an even better friend. It was a privilege working with you and I look forward to the day that I am able to reciprocate your kindness. I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. Kelly Swanson, Dr. Felipe Cardoso, and Dr. Erik Bruininx, for your expertise and wisdom you have shared with me throughout the course of my research. I also thank Lineke de Jong for all the great ideas and constructive criticism. I would also like to thank Dr. George Fahey for being on my preliminary exam committee and being instrumental in the early stages of this project. You all pushed me to work harder and it has paid off. This would not have been possible without valuable input from each and every one of you and I am forever grateful. I also express my gratitude to former and current members of the Stein lab: our research manager, post-docs, the staff and farm crew, and my fellow graduate students who were always there to lend a helping hand. This invaluable experience made me a better scientist and you have all contributed to that. It was truly a pleasure to have worked with a team of such talent and dedication. Thank you, I salute every single one of you. I thank all of the wonderful people whom I have met in this incredible journey. I always felt at home and never unwanted. You have all shaped me into a better individual. Champaign will always be my second home. I am truly grateful and will cherish our friendship for the rest of my life.
