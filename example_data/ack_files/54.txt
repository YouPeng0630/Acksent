This thesis would not have been possible without the support of many people. I wish to express my gratitude to all of them. First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor. Rui, you have been a kind and wise mentor throughout my doctoral studies. Your advice and your guidance have been invaluable, and your support has always been much appreciated. Thank you. I would also like to thank the members of the examination committee for taking the time to read my work, and for their helpful questions and comments. I would like to thank all other people at the mathematics department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. All of you have contributed to this project in one way or another, be it administratively, through teaching, or through one of countless other ways. I would also like to thank Arno Kuijlaars, who was the first person to suggest I go to the United States for my PhD, and Marius Crainic, who suggested I work with Rui. In the five years I spent working toward this thesis, I have had the pleasure of meeting many other mathematicians from all over the world. If I try to list them all here, I will inevitably forget some. I am grateful for all math-related and non-math-related conversations we had. Doing mathematical research is no easy task, and I often found myself at the climbing wall in an effort to clear my head. I would like to thank Matt for all the good times we had climbing, and for his friendship. I would like to thank my entire family for their love and support. I am eternally grateful to my parents, in particular, for raising me with incredible warmth and giving me all the opportunities anyone could ever want. You are truly exceptional. Finally, I would like to thank Annelies. Living an ocean apart has not been easy, and I am unable to count the hours we have spent on Skype. I want to thank you for your support, and for everything you do for me. Your love makes me a better person.
