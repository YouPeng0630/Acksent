First, I want to thank my advisor Prof. Kimani Toussaint, Jr. He offered me the opportunity to conduct research with freedom on nano-optics in the PROBE lab. We had many discussions that not only inspired my research but also guided me through my personal life. I would also like to thank Dr. Gabriel Spalding for leading me into the world of optics, and Dr. Hao Chen for sharing his tremendous experience and knowledge in optics with me. I have been pursuing higher education in Illinois for almost a decade. Without my familyâ€™s support, I would not be the person I am today. Special thanks to my mother, Guolan Li. I cannot be more grateful for her consistent patience, understanding and support.
