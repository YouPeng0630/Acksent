First, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor and dissertation chair, Dr. Anjal√© Welton, for her continued support, guidance, and patience throughout this journey. She kept me going and believed in me through the coursework and writing process. I would also like to thank my committee members, Dr. Alexander, Dr. Anderson, and Dr. Herrmann for their input and support along the way. My sincerest appreciation goes to my husband, Tracy Paul Robinson, who has been a constant source of support and encouragement during the challenges of graduate school and life. I am truly thankful for having him in my life. A special feeling of gratitude to my loving parents, Edward and Lillian McCarthy, whose words of encouragement and unconditional love have kept me focused. I give my deepest expression of love and appreciation for the encouragement that was given and the sacrifices made during this graduate program by my three children: Ryan, Adam, and Emma. They have each taught me in their own way to work hard for the things that I aspire to achieve; therefore, I dedicate my dissertation work to my loving family.
