I would like to offer sincere gratitude to Steven Banjavcic of S and S Database Consultants for all of his effort in the development of interpolation analysis software. Mr. Banjavcic’s contributions were essential to perform accurate and useful analysis on the significant amount of data utilized in this research. I would like to thank John Sloat and Diana Krupa of WaterCube and Craig Huhta of One Fish Engineering for the use of ADCP processing and visualization software. WaterCube is a leader in ADCP data processing and visualization software, with expertise in ADCP data collection and instrumentation. I would like to thank the United States Geological Survey (USGS), specifically Dr. Patrick Ryan Jackson, for providing the Mississippi River dataset for exploration along with significant guidance in understanding ADCP data. I would like to express appreciation to a few public agencies, private companies, and individual research assistants that provided data, equipment, and time for this research. This analysis would not have been possible without these wonderful partners. • Jack “Trey” Grubbs of the Suwannee River Water Management District • Jackie van Bosch of the Water and Sanitation Department of the Republic of South Africa • Mike Novotney and the Lake County Stormwater Management Commission • Kevin Labbe of Xylem, Inc.
