First to my advisor Anil N. Hirani, thank you for your mentorship and for teaching me what can be learned by continuously questioning what you think you know. Daniel Berwick-Evans, thank you for helping shape and focus the topics for this thesis and especially providing guidance about where to find interesting physics applications of this discretization framework. Thank you Kaushik Kalyanaraman both for our discussions, which helped me better understand DEC and FEEC and provided pathways for further exploration, as well as our friendship which made my time at Illinois much more enjoyable. To my funding agencies, the Physics department at the University of Illinois, the NSF thank you for having financially supported my Ph.D. work. And thanks to the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications for funding my travel to attend several conferences, they were truly illuminating. To my parents, Gary and Linda, thank you for first encouraging me to go into physics and for your support through all of these years of life and education. And my siblings John, Katelyn and Kimberly, thank you for our adventures growing up and for teaching me what school could not. And lastly, to my wife Mary who helped me through the entire process and listened to me ramble on about this work an innumerable number of times, thank you!
