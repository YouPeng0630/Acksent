I would like to thank my advisor, Prof. David Flaherty, for his guidance, dedication, and high spirits in times of difficulty. Without the strong example that he set and his high expectations for excellence, I would not be the researcher that I am today. I would also like to thank my labmates and colleagues who I am fortunate enough to have also as my friends. Specifically, I would like to thank Dr. SiWei (Andy) Chang and Megan Witzke who I have had the honor to work with the longest, as well as Pranjali Priyadrashini, Daniel Bregante, Yung-Tin (Frank) Pan, and Johanna Schr√∂der who have worked closely with me on this project in particular. Additionally, I would like to thank (former) undergraduate researchers Rong Jiao, Christine Rovani, and Luke Greenfield, who helped me both with the project and to grow as a mentor. I would like to thank Michael (Hodge) Harland for his help building whatever I needed to keep the project running smoothly and for always being someone I could talk to. Thank you to John Rosheck and Kyle Webb for their high-quality work building or repairing various pieces of research equipment. I would like to thank Rebecca Corman for proofreading this dissertation and for being a continuous source of support. I am immensely grateful to all my friends and family for believing in and supporting me during this time, particularly my parents Leslie and Barry Wilson, who have always been there for me.
