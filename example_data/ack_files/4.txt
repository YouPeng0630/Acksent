I would like to start by thanking my family and my fianc√©, Dan Reilly. They supported and encouraged me through the frustrations and triumphs of my Ph.D., which has taken more perseverance than I had originally expected, but has led to greater accomplishments as well. This program would have been much lonelier without you.
