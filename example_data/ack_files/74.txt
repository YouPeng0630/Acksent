I thank Prof. N. Sri Namachchivaya whose earlier work on delay equations motivated some questions of this thesis. The problems of chapters 3 and 6 were suggested by him. For the sections 2.5-2.6 and chapter 3, I have benefited greatly from his earlier articles on averaging using the martingale problem and on Lyapunov exponents for delay equations. I thank Prof. Volker Wihstutz for the suggestions and detailed comments on earlier versions of chapter 3. This chapter borrows the set-up from his earlier articles on Lyapunov exponents for delay equations. I thank Prof. Ilya Pavlyukevich for giving me time on skype for numerous discussions on aspects of large deviations pertaining to chapter 6. I thank Prof. Nicolas Perkowski for sharing his insights on stochastic processes during his visits to UIUC. I thank Professors Sue Ann Campbell, Soon-Jo Chung, Harry Dankowicz, Lee DeVille and Ilya Pavlyuke- vich for being part of the doctoral committee. I’m grateful to Prof. Sri Namachchivaya, Prof. Oliver O’Reilly, NSF and AFOSR for the funding received under grants NSF CMMI 1030144, 1000906 and AFOSR FA9550-17-1-0001. The financial assistance provided by the Aerospace Engineering department, through the teaching assistantships and travel grants, has been of great help.
