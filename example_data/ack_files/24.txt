No person has been more instrumental in supporting the completion of my degree than my wife, Summer Meier. I want to thank her for her relentless patience and undeviating confidence in me throughout this entire experience. Her constant encouragement, support, and technical acuity were tremendous assets as I worked on my Ph.D. I want to thank Seth Hutchinson and Soon-Jo Chung for the extensive personal and professional guidance they provided, they taught me a great deal about engineering research. Their patience and the many learning opportunities they provided were instrumental in completing this dissertation. I also want to thank Alex Schwing and Minh Do for reviewing my work and providing insightful feedback that improved the research in this dissertation. I would also like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the SMART scholarship for service program (Office of Secretary Defense-Test and Evaluation, Defense-Wide/PE0601120D8Z National Defense Education Program (NDEP)/BA-1, Basic Research), and the Office of Naval Research (grant number N00014-14-1-0265). I want to thank the many friends and collaborators I had the pleasure to work and associate with at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and at my local church. I also want to thank all the members of my family. I would like to thank my parents for their support and encouragement; I cannot give them enough credit for the many sacrifices they made throughout my life which allowed me to pursue and complete this degree.
