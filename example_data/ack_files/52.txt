Professor Elena Delgado encouraged me to pursue a PhD and write a dissertation long before I believed that I could do those things, and by doing so, she has given me an incredible and enduring gift. It has been my great honor and sincere pleasure to read with her, write for her and teach with her over these past few years. Professor Joyce Tolliver has been a true pillar of my graduate studies; she has so patiently and generously listened to me work through many versions of this project and has always guided me in the directions that best reflect my interests and my strengths. Professors John Wilcox, Dara Goldman, Pilar Martínez-Quiroga, Ericka Beckman and Teresa Fuentes Peris have also helped me at various stages of this process; their willingness to share their knowledge, their bibliographies, their feedback and their experiences has been invaluable. Many thanks to Juan Carlos León Brázquez for so eagerly sharing his research on Concha Espina. Thanks to Aditya and Ridhi Malhotra for making many happy memories possible and for transporting many books across the world for me. Thanks to Sally Perret for her remarkable ability to keep all things literary, professional, and personal, in perspective, and thanks also to many other colleagues at UIUC, especially those who arrived with me to Illinois from far and wide in 2007, who made graduate school much more meaningful. I must thank my parents, Martin and Barbara, for always making my education, and my happiness, a priority. I am also forever grateful for and amazed by the love and support that I have received from four generations of my Mehrotra family. I am so inspired by their ongoing committment to build something better and to do it together. Finally, I must acknowledge Hilary Anne Weimer, who was there at the start of this process to help me focus on important things, and whose memory gives me courage to move forward.
