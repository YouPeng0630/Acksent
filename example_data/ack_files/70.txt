There were many individuals who contributed to the development of this Master’s thesis. First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Pro- fessor Lara Waldrop, for her technical guidance (and patience) throughout the duration of my graduate studies. It was an honor to work for such a pas- sionate scientist the last two years. In addition, I would also like to thank my advisors across the quad in CSL, Professors Farzad Kamalabadi and Zhizhen Zhao. I thank them for inciteful suggestions and useful discussions regarding the signal processing aspects of this project. Without the help and encour- agement of these three individuals, this work would not have been possible. There were many individuals throughout my time here at Illinois that I would also like to acknowledge. I’d like to thank the ECE Buds: Shruti Vaidya, Umberto Ravaioli, Daisy Fong, Kin Man Lee, Vivian Hou, and Ben Kuo (Status) for those afternoons spent working in the atrium and those late nights building robots in ESPL during undergrad studies. I would also like to thank the members of the RSSS team: Jianqi Qin, Gonzalo Cucho, Yamuna Phal, Pratik Joshi, Bill Wang, Paul Lee, Shiyi Yang, Matt Grawe, Anil Agarwal, and Tony Caton for lively discussions on ionospheric physics, optics, and other tea-time related topics. In addition, I’d also like to thank the many roommates of 803, Daniel Tu, Felipe Fregoso, Abhi Deshpande, Mitchell Quigley, Top, and Kevin Dvorak for being my family away from family. Finally, this all would not be possible without the support of my family. I thank my parents for not giving up on me and encouraging me to pursue engineering. I thank my younger brother Brendan for his encouragement, enthusiasm, and support. The work presented in this thesis was funded in part by NASA grant NNX16AF77G.
