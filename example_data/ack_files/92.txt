This dissertation could not have been possible without the help and support of many different people. First and foremost, I must thank Professor Bassem Andrawes for providing me with the opportunity to take on this research in the first place and for his guidance through it all. His vision and expertise provided the foundation upon which to build my knowledge and helped me find my direction as a scholar. I simply would not be who I am today without him. I also want to sincerely thank Professor Carlos Armando Duarte for introducing me to PFEM and his invaluable guidance. My interest in numerical analysis and computational methods truly burgeoned under his tutelage. I would also like to sincerely thank my other committee members, Professor James LaFave and Professor David Lange for their insightful feedback on this dissertation, as well as Tim Prunkard, Darold Marrow, Don Marrow, and the entire Civil Engineering Machine Shop for their assistance in the experimental component of this research. I must also thank members of our research group, both old and new. Dr. Qiwen Chen, Hang Zhao, Minsoo Sung, and Pratik Deogekar have all helped me in various ways and I am grateful. I have made so many great friends during my time here at the University of Illinois that I cannot possibly thank them all individually within the confines of a few pages. I owe a particular debt of gratitude to Donghyuk Jung who has become a brother to me. His help was instrumental in my experimental work and his words of encouragement helped me through some very tough times. Along the same lines, I must also thank Dr. Hajin Choi who has always been a guiding example and thank all the Korean students in Civil Engineering, particularly Andy Hur, Jaeho Shin, Homin Song, and Soonpil Kang for keeping me sane. I also want to thank some old friends
