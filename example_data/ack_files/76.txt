Working toward a Ph.D. in economics is a humbling experience. As the days go by, you accumulate so many debts of gratitude that you reach a point where you are no longer sure how much of the progress you have made is your own. This has certainly been my case at Illinois. I would like to thank my advisor Stephen Parente for helping me to fulfill my dreams by showing me the rugged path toward finishing this dissertation, and for supporting me during each stage. He taught me that to become an economist is like “crossing the river by feeling the stones under the feet”, as Den Xiaoping supposedly once said. Steve Parente was always available for discussion, and he tried to the make the best out of our meetings even when my ideas were still far from sound. It was a privilege to work under his advice, and I know that a simple thank you does not do justice in expressing my gratitude towards him. I gratefully acknowledge the rest of the members of my dissertation com- mittee for their support and timely feedback. I would like to thank Anne Villamil for her words of encouragement and for always combining technical advice without sending me to get lost in the woods. I also thank Rui Zhao for her insightful and challenging comments on the technical aspects of the project. I learned a lot about my own research during my attempts to pro- vide reasonable answers to her keen questions. Last, I would like to thank Marcelo Bucheli for his insights on my findings, which motivated me to start thinking about myself as a scholar even at early stages of the Ph.D. My re- lation with Marcelo goes back for more than a decade, when I enrolled in his Economic History class at Universidad de los Andes, in Bogota´ (Colombia). Since then, I knew that I wanted to shape my life around academia, and it has been a privilege to work with him and get to know him as a colleague, a mentor, and a friend. I also owe gratitude to Robert Lucas. If one needs inspiration during
