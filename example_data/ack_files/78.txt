Before anyone else the credit of course goes to my advisor Paris Smaragdis. As my dear labmate Johannes Traa once wrote in his thesis acknowledgements page, Paris really is a real kick-ass advisor (in the best way). Thank you Paris for tolerating all my crazy actions, giving me the freedom to do whatever I want to do, and saving me from the downward slope I was in during my 3rd year. Also, Bulent hoca and Taylan hoca for all their support during my masters and undergrad. They were quite instrumental in motivating me to pursue a career in research. I also want to thank Sanmi Koyejo for the collaboration which made Chapter 4 of this thesis possible. Johannes Traa, the name I already mentioned, has been central in this thesis. He was my co-author for the first half of my Ph.D. (method of moments stuff and the first factorial hmm paper). But much more importantly he has been a great friend from whom I believe I learned a lot. Minje Kim, who is now a serious college professor also helped me a lot in gaining self confidence. We never got to collaborate, but maybe someday. I would like to thank Yves Petinot for being a kindred spirit. My lab-mate Shrikant Venkataramani was also instrumental in my recovery in my fourth year. We wrote the convolutive neural network paper together in the dining hall of Uber’s headquaters, and got a best paper award for it. Quite awesome stuff. I also want to thank my friend Sertan Alkan for being a real friend throughout the years. I also want to thank my labmates in office 3332 for tolerating all my assholish and territorial behavior. Also thank you father and mother for all the support in all aspects, and allowing me to be and do whatever I want. (I still don’t have a significant other so I pass on that one.)
