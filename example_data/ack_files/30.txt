Foremost, I am extremely grateful to my advisor Brian DeMarco for his support and academic guidance. When I joined the group, I was afraid of communicating with others and asking questions. Brian encouraged me to express my own ideas. When I was worried about my future career, Brian was the one who shared his experience and cheered me up. I will always remember when we worked together for a whole weekend on the spectroscopy measurements of Rydberg energy levels and finally succeeded. I would like to thank Stanimir Kondov and William McGehee, who were the senior graduate students when I joined the group. They not only built the K apparatus from which I benefited, but also instructed me how to be a good experimentalist. It has also been a great pleasure to work with the other members on K team including Will Morong, Pei-Wen Tsai, and Lucas Slattery. I want to thank the group members on Rb team, including Carrie Meldgin, David Chen, Phil Russ, and Laura Wadleigh. Carrie taught me how to measure the trap frequencies of an optical dipole trap on my first day in the lab. David, Phil, and Laura were always willing to share their progress on the Rb apparatus. I also want to thank Prof. Bryce Gadway and his group members Eric, Alex, and Jackson for helpful discussions. Finally, I would like to thank my family for their support and love through the years, especially to my parents who listened to my feelings at midnight in China. Many thanks to my hometown, Nanjing, who always welcome me back with her nice food and beautiful planetrees. I acknowledge generous support from the University of Illinois, NSF, ARO, and DARPA.
