I wish to thank God and my family for all their help and support during my Ph. D. work. I also want to thank my adviser, Randy H. Ewoldt, for all his help and guidance during my time as a graduate student. I also wish to thank Yong Hoon Lee and James T. Allison for their help in design appropriate modeling, and Paul Fischer for his guidance on implementing the numerical models presented here. Finally, I want to thank the members of the Mechanical Engineering Machine Shop, the Chemistry Glass Shop, and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Machine Shop who made the materials used in our experimental tests.
