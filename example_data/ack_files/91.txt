I would like to thank my advisor, Philip Phillips, for his guidance throughout my Ph.D. study. I would like to thank my thesis committee members, Taylor Hughes, Lance Cooper, and Thomas Faulkner, for the time they spend on evaluating my thesis work.

I would like to thank other people from my research group, Gabriele La Nave, Wei-Cheng Lee, Tony Hegg, Garrett Vanacore, Brandon Langley, Bikash Padhi, Christian Boyd, Shuyi Zhang, and Luke Yeo. I have discussed many physics research ideas with them.

I acknowledge the support by the Physics Department at the University of Illinois for my work as a teaching assistant and by a scholarship from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Royal Thai Government. Finally, I would like to thank my parents for raising me up and always giving me moral support.
