My thanks to you, Professor Placid M. Ferreira. I have never met an individual with such openness towards new ideas. I am inspired by you every day to approach problems in different ways and to push my own creativity to think outside the box and always think bigger (or smaller in our current ventures). My thanks to my mother and father, Gayle and Thomas Toombs, and my brother Joseph for believing in me always. My thanks to Jorge Eduardo Correa Panesso for the unwavering support and constructive advice when it was needed most. I would also like to thank all of my laboratory colleagues that helped me along the way. And a special thanks to Professor Keng Hsu at Arizona State University for collaborating on the 3d printed metallic parts for this project.
