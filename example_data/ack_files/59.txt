I write the following words of thanks with deep gratitude.  First, I want to thank my committee members—Fritz Drasgow, Jim Rounds, Dan Newman, and Teresa Cardador.  They continue to be exceptional mentors and role models marked by kindness, rigor, expertise, and collegiality.  I am most fortunate to have worked with each of them. I want to especially thank my advisor, Fritz Drasgow.  As at day one, I feel deeply privileged to have had Fritz as an advisor.  He is wise, kind, thorough, and practical.  His professional and personal investment has influenced my life and work for the better.  Fritz, thank you for your strong support throughout my doctoral studies. I dedicate this dissertation to the two most important people in my life—my wife, Kirsten, and my daughter, Ebba.  Kirsten, thank you for your friendship, abiding love, and support—you’re the inspiration.  Ebba, you bring me much joy and were the best writing buddy a person could ask for.  I love you both.
