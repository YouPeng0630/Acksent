First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. William â€œBill Myers of Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Professor Tomasz Kozlowski for their support in making this dissertation possible. Their knowledge and encouragement have been invaluable as I developed my dissertation. Bill took me on as an intern in the summer of 2012. He motivated me to continue my education. He has been a dedicated mentor, listening to all my ideas, good and bad, and encouraging me to continue my education. I could not ask for a better advisor, confidant, or friend. In 2014, Professor Kozlowski took me on as a student. Since then, he has been everything I could have asked for in an academic advisor. Professor Kozlowski has been extremely helpful and patient; while, I made his job more difficult from 1500 miles away. Both Bill and Professor Kozlowski alleviated many of the stresses that arose during the execution of an experimental dissertation. In addition to Dr. Myers and Professor Kozlowski, I would like to thank the rest of my committee: Professor Uddin, Professor Stubbins, and Professor Perdekamp for their insightful comments and willingness to assist me in my academic development. I want to thank Dave Hayes, my group leader at LANL. Despite his busy schedule, he always found time to provide technical advice. I realize that without his hard work I would not have any work to present. I have not had many managers in my short career, but I know that I have been fortunate to work with Dave. He truly embodies everything to which a technical manager should aspire. I owe Travis Grove, Jesson Hutchinson, Rene Sanchez, and Joetta Goda a huge thank you for their support in implementing my experiments. Most of all, I want to thank each of them for being an excellent sounding board as I worked through the meaning of my results. I would also thank them for providing an excellent work environment that inspired learning.
