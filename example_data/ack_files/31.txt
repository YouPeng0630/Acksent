I would like to thank Professor J. Stephen Downie, Ryan Dubnicek, and the HathiTrust Research Center for providing the opportunity to begin this research project as part of the Oxford-Illinois Digital Libraries Placement Programme. I extend a special thanks to Edith Halvarsson for her constant support during the placement and for encouraging me to extend this research into a thesis. I would also like to thank Michael Popham, Sarah Mason, and all the folks at the Bodleian Digital Library Systems and Services, and the Oxford e-Research Centre. I would also like to thank my advisors, Professor Jerome McDonough and Professor Allen Renear, who enabled me to extend the summer research project into a Masterâ€™s thesis. Both Dr. McDonough and Dean Renear patiently worked with me as I fixated until the last minute of nearly every deadline on aspects of the thesis, that as a continuous piece of research would never be complete. To Jerome, I would like to extend special thanks for encouraging me to consider every aspect of importance and for identifying complex files for my dataset. I would like to thank the Illinois School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for developing a program that encourages its students to engage in research. Finally, I would like to thank my family, friends, and colleagues for their support and flexibility when it seemed that I would never have enough time or energy. Wayne Ryan, thank you for always encouraging me to strive for things that, to me, seem impossible to achieve.
