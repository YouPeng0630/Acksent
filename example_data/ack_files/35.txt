There are incredible people who made this work possible. I started asking questions that ultimately led to this work almost 10 years ago. Since then I have had the benefit of insight and incredible unwavering support from my advisor, Roy Axford. Marius has been an amazing teacher and an inspiring analyst. Rizwan has been a continually supportive friend and mentor. Joyce helped me to be patient and keep working to solve problems when it felt impossible. My Mom has always helped me to stay realistic about the research and writing process. My friends, family, teachers, and colleagues have all been supportive and encouraging. Without all of them this would not have been possible. This research was performed in part using funding received from the DOE Office of Nuclear Energyâ€™s Nuclear Energy University Programs.
