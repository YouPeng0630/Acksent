Since I came to UIUC in spring 2014 until now, Iâ€™ve had a very unforgettable PhD life. And I want to thank many people who have been part of my wonderful life journey here in Champaign- Urbana, IL. I would like to first appreciate my PhD advisor, Prof. Huck Beng Chew, who brought me to the new field of multiscale computation and the interesting research topic of Li-ion batteries. He spent a lot of time discussing research with me, through which I learned how to approach a research problem, how to formulate a research paper and how to make a professional presentation. I would then like to thank Prof. Geubelle, Prof. Lambros and Prof. Ertekin for serving on my Doctoral committee and also for their sound suggestions for my research. Besides, I also had the fortune to take courses from some other famous solid mechanics scholars, such as Prof. Sehitoglu, Prof. Masud, Prof. Sofronis and Prof. Starzewski. I spent many sleepless nights when taking those courses and I also gained lots of unique knowledge that makes the study experience at UIUC different from others. I want to thank my group colleagues. We discussed about research and course studies. We also share lots of interesting life memories. I also want to acknowledge the support of National Science Foundation (Grant No. NSF- CMMI-1300805), as well as super-computational resources provided by TACC (Grant No. TGMSS130007), and Blue Waters at NCSA. At the end, I want to thank my family for their support and encouragement.
