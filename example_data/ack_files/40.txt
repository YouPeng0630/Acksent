First and foremost, I am indebted to my dissertation advisors, Professors Eliza Forsythe and Minchul Shin, for their support and advice throughout this long and dicult process. Without their guidance, I would not have been able to complete this dissertation – for me, they are model researchers and professors. I am particularly grateful to Minchul Shin. His course in Bayesian econometrics totally changed my perspective on economics research, and his advice helped me discover the key spirit of this dissertation project. I am also grateful to Eliza Forsythe for her support while I worked as her research assistant. I really appreciate her giving me the oppor- tunity to work with her and learn how to do research; my work beneted a great deal from her mentorship. Next, I want to express my deep gratitude to my dissertation commiee members, Professors George Deltas, Stefan Krasa and Zhigang Feng. eir advice and comments inspired me and signicantly improved my dissertation. I also want to give special thanks to Professor Woong Yong Park, my third year paper supervisor, who continued to help with my research for the duration of my Ph.D. program. I am really grateful to these great researchers whom I was lucky enough meet here at UIUC. e life of a Ph.D. student is full of ups and downs, and I was fortunately surrounded by kind, generous, and smart people during my time at UIUC. I am very thankful that I met my roommate, Tsung-Wei Huang. He was a valuable source of support when I faced challenges in my Ph.D. life. I am likewise grateful to Professor Hassan Arvin-Rad. I worked as his grader from the beginning of my Ph.D. Program, and I really appreciated his constant support and patience. I also oer thanks to my fellow graduate students Camila Henao Arbelaez, Yuci Chen, Aram Grigoryan, Daniel Halim, Ding Yong Tan and Bei Yang for their help in my journey while pursuing my Ph.D., and to Cesare Buiai, Gustavo Cortes, Sebastian Laumer and Whayoung Jung for their insightful
