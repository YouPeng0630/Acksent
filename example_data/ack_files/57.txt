Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. Ben Hooberman for the continuous support of my Ph.D study and job appli- cations, for his patience, motivation, enthusiasm, and immense knowledge. Prof. Hooberman has been always flexible and allows me to pursue my cre- ativities, even when sometimes these ideas are not directly related to his research projects.. I enjoyed my Ph.D life working with Prof. Hooberman, and I am very glad that we produced many good scientific results. I thank my another advisor, Prof. Tony Liss, who continues guiding me with my study after he left Illinois. With Prof. Tonyâ€™s guidance, I establish my confidence in science research. I would also like to thank Dr. Zach Marshall, Dr. Emma Kuwertz, and Dr. Jon Long for their help in developing the photon template method. I especially thank Dr. Marshall for his supports and advises on the career in science and his time and energy on providing me feedback on some of my original ideas on particle physics.
