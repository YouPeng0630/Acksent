I would like to express my deep gratitude to my advisor Dr. Susan Schantz. Throughout my time in graduate school, she has struck a wonderful balance of providing guidance and allowing me to develop my skills as an independent scientist. Her mentorship has helped to make my time in graduate school the happiest and most fulfilling of my life so far. I would also like to thank my former lab members, Dr. Steven Neese, Dr. Suren Bandara and Dr. Supida Monaikul, along with our laboratory technician Mindy Howe. They were an enormous help to me, especially in my early graduate school years. I greatly appreciate the additional feedback and guidance I have received from Dr. Donna Korol. Much of the work detailed in this document would not have been possible without her previous work and continuous thoughtful input on my projects. I would also like to thank Dr. Jodi Flaws for generously opening her lab to me. Not only did it give me the opportunity to learn new skills, but her mentorship will serve as a model for me for the rest of my scientific career. The members of my thesis committee have also been instrumental in my progress through graduate school, and I would like to thank them for their feedback. I feel very fortunate to be a part of the Neuroscience Program at the University of Illinois. The flexibility and diversity of the program in addition to the collegial atmosphere created by the faculty and students make it an ideal graduate school environment. In my personal life, I would like to acknowledge my partner Dr. Benjamin Zimmerman for his indispensable contributions to my life in science as well as outside of it. I would also like to thank the wonderful friends I have made here, as well as my unwaveringly supportive family.
