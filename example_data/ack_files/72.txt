This research would not have been possible without the support of the National Science Foundation, via grant No. 1506416. I would like to thank my advisor, Naomi Makins, for sharing her enthusiasm for physics, which is what first drew me to her group. I would like to offer my thanks to the professionals in the McKinley Mental Health department, without which it is possible my anxiety and depression would have prevented me from completing this thesis. I would also like to thank the physics department at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, for not kicking me to the curb when I took much longer than usual to complete my degree requirements.
