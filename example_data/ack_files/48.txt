Firstly, I would like to thank to my committee chair and organ instructor, Dr. Dana Robinson, for his continuous support, encouragement, and patience throughout my time at the University of Illinois. I also want to thank my research adviser, Dr. Gabriel Solis; his guidance and passion in this project helped me during the entire process of research and writing. Additional thanks go to the rest of my committee, Dr. Christos Tsitsaros and Dr. Carlos Carrillo, who have kept inspiring me through their immense knowledge. Besides my committee members, I would like to thank many professors in the Department of Music whom I met through my studyâ€”especially, Dr. Charlotte Mattax, chair of the Organ and Harpsicord Division, and Dr. Misumi Sadler from the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures. My many years of study would have not been made possible without support and funding from both departments. In addition, I would like to thank Dr. Fred Stoltzfus, professor emeritus of Choral Music, who helped me to cultivate musicality. My sincere thanks also go to Dr. Robert Gjerdingen at Northwestern University, who personally supported my research. I am greatly indebted to my parents, Noriko and Satoru, for their continuous support. Most importantly, I could have not finished this project without the help and unconditional love of my wife, Asami. Lastly, I would like to thank my friends at Champaign-Urbana, especially, Rev. Heidi Weatherford, Rev. Keith Harris, Margo Chaney, Nancy Stagg, the other choir members, and the congregation at McKinley Presbyterian Church and Foundation.
