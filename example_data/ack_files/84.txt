I would like to thank Dr. Naiman Khan for his guidance and assistance throughout my time here both academically and professionally. I would also like to thank Dr. Charles Hillman, Dr. Rodney Johnson, and Dr. Hannah Holscher for providing support and suggestions for my thesis and for serving on my graduate advisory committee. Additionally, I want to thank all of the co- authors on my first publication which encompassed my thesis work, Dr. Lauren Raine, Dr. Eric Drollette, Dr. Mark Scudder, Dr. Arthur Kramer, and again, Dr. Charles Hillman and Dr. Naiman Khan. My gratitude is also extended to my fellow graduate students Nick Baumgartner, Alicia Covello, Caitlyn Edwards, and Grace Niemiro; our lab coordinators Ginger Reeser and Linda Steinberg; our post-doc Dr. Anne Walk; our lab technicians Jackson Evensen, Ruyu Liu, Isabel Flemming, and Bibiana Schell; and the many undergraduate assistants who helped in the data collection for this project.  I also want to thank my husband, Tomasz Chojnacki, because without his endless support, emotionally and financially, I would have never been able to start, let alone finish, this degree. Also, of course, I owe so much gratitude and thanks to my mom and dad, Pat and Tresa Curran, and my grandfather, Doug Groover for always pushing me to be the best person I could be and because without them I would not be where I am today. Finally, additional thanks go out to the rest of my family and friends for their endless support during my program.
