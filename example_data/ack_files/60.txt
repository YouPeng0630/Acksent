I started the journey towards this dissertation study four years ago, but time seems to have gone much quicker than that. I wasn’t certain I would even be admitted to the program when I applied, and now I can say with sincerity that I have found my calling. First and foremost, sincere thanks to my committee: Dr. Marilyn Parsons, Dr. Chris Higgins, Dr. Barbara Hug, and Dr. Sarah McCarthey. When I explain what a dissertation committee is to friends and family, I often say that they’re an assemblage of your “dream team” mentors. That is certainly true of the scholars who have worked with me these past few years. It is an honor to be able to have my work examined by you all, and I look to each of you for inspiration in my future career in academia. I also need to thank my students, those whom I taught in the K-12 setting and the outstanding preservice teachers I have worked with here at UIUC. When I applied to the program I didn’t know that I would be given the opportunity to teach at all, let alone come to study preservice teachers! Just as every teacher hopes to touch the lives of a few of her students, I am so privileged to say that more students than I can count have impacted my life in some meaningful way. My preservice teachers, especially, have brought me such pride and happiness the past four years. I am so proud of all of you and the teachers you have become! Special thanks to Alicia, Raul, Daniel, and the other (non-included) participants in this study, for your generosity of time and perspective. Speaking with you all during your busy student teaching semester was one of my favorite times in my PhD program. I learned so much from all of you and owe this project to your voices. Thank you to my friends and mentors in the College of Ed. Especially:
