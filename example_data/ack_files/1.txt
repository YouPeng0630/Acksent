I am tremendously grateful to all of the professors who guided me as I wrote this paper. Thank you to my adviser, Dr. Brenna Ellison, for being incredible throughout the whole process. I appreciate all the feedback, ideas and encouragement you have given me.  Thank you Dr. Alex Winter-Nelson, for giving me guidance as I first started formulating research ideas.  And thank you Dr. Amy Ando, for providing feedback and ideas in the early stages of this project.  Finally, I want to thank my mom and my dad for all they have sacrificed for my brother, my sister and me.
