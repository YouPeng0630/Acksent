I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Elyse Rosenbaum, for her patience and guidance during the past five and one-half years. This work could not be completed without her support. I would also like to thank many former and current students, including Robert Mertens, Min-Sun Keel, Zaichen Chen, Nicholas Thomson, Kuo-Hsuan Meng, Vrashank Shukla, Collin Reiman, and Dabin Zhang, for the help and inspiration from our discussions. And finally, I very much appreciate the support of my family through all these years.
