To my parents, Bill and Anita Earl, thank you for your unwavering support as I pursue my dream of becoming a Counseling Psychologist. The daily phone calls of encouragement, comfort, and love helped me more that you will ever know. To my fianc√©, Daniel Bolsen, thank you for keeping me rooted in my values and for always challenging me to grow. To my dog, Ariel, thank you for reminding me that joy can be found even in the darkest of times. Finally, thank you to all of my close friends who have shown selflessness with their time, support, intellect, and wisdom. Your loyalty, humor, and empathy are some of the best gifts I have ever received.
