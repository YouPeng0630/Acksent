I would like to thank the many people who have aided in the completion of this dissertation. First of all, this project would not have reached its conclusion without the unwavering dedication and expert guidance of the members of my doctoral committee at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Their expertise as scholars in the field of music education has inspired me to become a better researcher, writer, thinker, and teacher. The many things they have taught me will continue to influence my work throughout my career, and I am extremely appreciative of the extra work they put in to accommodate my nontraditional doctoral trajectory. Thanks to Dr. Donna Gallo, Co-Director, who took on the role of statistical guru and went well above and beyond to help develop chapters three and four even before she officially became my Co-Director. Dr. Janet R. Barrett, Co-Director, guided my work since I started my doctoral journey, always challenged me to see the bigger picture, and has by far the keenest eye for APA I have ever encountered. Dr. Louis Bergonzi helped direct this project throughout major parts of its development and spent many hours with me on Skype during my planning period discussing word choice. Dr. Bridget Sweet always provided valuable insight as an experienced choral researcher and practitioner. Dr. Jeananne Nichols joined the committee at the end of the voyage but offered an important perspective as a champion of music students and teachers whose voices may not always be heard. I want to thank my colleagues and friends at Western Illinois University, particularly Dr. Chris Lapka, who started me on my academic path as my undergraduate advisor 20 years ago and continues to be a mentor for me now as a colleague. Thanks to Dr. Tammie Walker, Director of the WIU School of Music, for her patience and assistance as this project lingered longer than expected. I am also very appreciative for Dave Towers and Colin Harbke of the WIU Center for
