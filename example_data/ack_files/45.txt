First, I would like to thank Professor Faranak Miraftab. As my thesis advisor, she provided priceless feedback, both insightful and precise, combining rigor and flexibility. As a female international scholar, her presence encouraged me to become a researcher. As a human being, her example shifted my understanding of responsibility, redefining what caring for others means. Your presence in my life brought me a bag of lessons to unfold in the years to come.
