Research funds were provided by a grant from the National Honey Board. I would like to thank Ling-Hsiu Liao and Wen-Yen Wu for their support and assistance in the honey bee bioassays. Their initial guidance and help with the development of the methodology was incredibly useful, as well as their continued support when I had to troubleshoot any issues. I would also like to thank William Montag for his assistance in running the assay during the time periods that I was out of town. I also thank my advisor, May Berenbaum, for her advice and encouragement throughout the course of my master’s degree. Her guidance, feedback, and edits were instrumental to my success in the entomology department. Finally, I’d like to thank my boyfriend Wade Coufal for being my biggest support during my time as a graduate student, especially during the most stressful periods. His unwavering encouragement gave me the motivation to always be a better student, teacher, and researcher here at University of Illinois.
