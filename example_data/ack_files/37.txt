Τῶν γονέων τοὺς διδασκάλους piροτιμᾶν, οἱ μὲν γὰρ τοῦ ζῇν, οἱ δὲ τοῦ εῦ᾿ ζῇν γεγόνασιν αἴτιοι. Ισοκρατης, Αριστοτελης, Αλεξανδρος First and above all, I wish to express my warmest acknowledgments to my doctorate advisor, Professor Steven Bradlow for his generous support, patience and guidance during the preparation of this dissertation. Without his expertise and constant help, this thesis would have never seen the light of day. I am also particularly grateful to Indranil Biswas, Olivier Guichard, Jan Swoboda, Nicolaus Treib, Hartmut Weiss and Richard Wentworth for shared insights on the topics covered in this thesis. A very special thanks to Rafe Mazzeo for a series of illuminating discussions and a wonderful hospitality during a visit to Stanford University in April 2016. Last, but not least, I am very grateful to the Mathematics Department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and all its people, as well as to the GEAR Mathematical Network for providing so many rewarding opportunities during my graduate studies. This dissertation is dedicated with esteem to my entire family and to all those who I consider to have been my instructors in my course so far.
