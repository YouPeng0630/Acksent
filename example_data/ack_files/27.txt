This thesis would have not been possible to realize without the invaluable support and guidance of my advisor and academic father Dr Carl A. Gunter. Professor Gunter trusted me to explore issues that I find interesting without any constraints. I consider myself privileged to be given the opportunity to work and learn from Dr. Gunter. I can not imagine having a better advisor and mentor. I would like to also thank Dr Xiaofeng Wang, whose indispensable guidance was continuous throughout my work. I was lucky during the beginning of my studies to meet with Professor Wang who got me involved in smartphone security, a topic which became the focus of my thesis. Unequivocally I learnt a lot during my interactions with Professor Wang both on how to find interesting problems and how to approach solving them. Special thanks to Dr Klara Nahrstedt and Adam M. Bates for their feedback and guidance. The final version of this thesis is shaped based on their astute observations. My sincere thanks also goes to Dr. Michael Grace and Dr. Xiaoyong Zhou who provided me with an opportunity to join their team as intern at Samsung Research America (SRA). At SRA I got exposed to real problems modern smartphone operating system vendors face and the approaches they take to tackle them. Lastly, I would like to thank all the people I got to work with during my Ph.D. studies: Dr. Carl A. Gunter; Dr. XiaoFeng Wang; Dr. Klara Nahrstedt; Dr. Kyu-Han Kim; Dr. Landon Cox; Dr. Patrick Tague; Dr. Xiaoyong Zhou; Dr. Muhammad Naveed; Dr. Michael Grace; Dr. Puneet Jain; Dr. Wei Yang; Dr. Aston Zhang; Dr. Yueh-Hsun Lin; Dr. Yuan Tian; Dr. Animesh Shrivastava; Dr. Wenrui Diao; Dr. Feng Qian; Dr. Kai Chen; Dr. Xinhui Han; Dr. Kehuan Zhang; Dongjing He; Xiaorui Pan; Yeonjoon Lee; Kan Yuan; Whitney Merrill; Gliz Seray Tuncay; Tongxin Li; Mingming Zha; Nan Zhang; Xianghang Mi; Peiyuan Zong; Karan Ganju. My interactions with all of them shaped me both as an academic and as a person.
