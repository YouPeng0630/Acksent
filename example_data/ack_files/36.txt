I would first like to thank my mentor, Nick for trusting my capabilities and bringing me onboard. He consistently allowed me to navigate my own course and provided me all the support and encouragement as I treaded unfamiliar waters. I am grateful for all the newly- gained skills and knowledge. I've been fortunate to have had this opportunity. I would also like to thank the people who were involved in this project; specifically, members of the Nutrition and Exercise Performance Research Group and Dr. Naiman Khan. Without their dedication and commitment, this project would have not successfully set sail. To our little group of Pinoys in the plains and my Freer friends… thank you, it’s been an awesome session. I wish you fair winds and following seas ahead! Padayon! Finally, to my parents, Mama and Dado - who have inspired me to live a life of service, passion and adventure, and my brother Mark… thank you to all of you for the unwavering love and support and reminding me to stay on an even keel. I would also like to acknowledge my other family members who have buoyed my spirits along the way. A special shout out to tita Sarah and tita Liza for all the graduate school wisdom and reassurance, especially on days when I am “at sea”. All of this would not have been possible without them and His guidance. Maraming Salamat.
