Thank you to all who have offered their support and guidance throughout the course of this project. I would especially like to thank my advisor, Dr. Sharon Nickols- Richardson, for her encouragement and vison for my research. I consider myself lucky to have had the opportunity to study under someone with her unmatched ethics and genuine curiosity. I would also like to thank my committee members: Dr. Barbara Fiese, Dr. Manabu Nakamura, and Dr. M. Yanina Pepino. Your guidance throughout the development and execution of this study has been invaluable. In addition, my thanks go to Dr. Soo-Yeun Lee for allowing us to borrow her laptop computers, Dr. Megan Dailey for her advice and use of her laboratory space, Dr. Jeffery Brunstrom for his assistance with the RVIP task, and Dr. Kelly Tu for her assistance with the plan of analysis. Most importantly, I thank my participants without whom this study would not have been possible. My deepest appreciation goes to the undergraduate students who worked on this project: Stacy Chan, Yijie Cheng, Madeleine Collanto, Cheyenne Henry, Chrison Hu, Crystal Lopez, Lindsey Oettel, Noelle Park, Megan Reingold, Emily Schierer, Taryn Schnoor, Wendy Shuhan, Yirong Wang, Yu Wang, Frederick Yang, and Cherie Yu.  I know coming into the lab at 7am was not an exciting prospect, but this work could not have be done without their commitment to the project. Thank you to my amazing NR labmates, both past and present. Thanks to Henna for always offering some perspective and reminding me that itâ€™s alright to take my time. Thanks to April for all the late night meals, conversation, and especially the laughter. Thanks to Cassandra for being my travel partner, statistics guru, confidant, Wonder
