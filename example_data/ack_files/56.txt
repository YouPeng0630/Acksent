I have been fortunate to have so many people in my life who have supported me through this doctoral journey. Truth be told—this section should be the longest section of my dissertation. First, I owe a debt of gratitude to my dissertation committee. To my chair, Dr. Rosenblatt, thank you for your guidance through this process and for your patience with my many questions. Thanks, too, for the required weekly presentations in your Cancer Epidemiology class that helped me overcome my aversion to public speaking. Dr. Klonoff-Cohen, thank you for your support and for your recommendations of developing iterative timelines that helped keep me on track throughout this process. Dr. Farner, thank you piquing my interest in rural health as a master’s student that led me down this career path, and thank you for being my teaching “mentor” during my coursework. Dr. McLafferty, thank you for sharing your spatial expertise and for helping me learn how to think more like a social scientist. Dr. Sherman, thank you for helping me better understand some of the nuances of cancer registry data and for being generous with your time to be part of my committee. Thank you to the cancer registry staff and cancer registrars in the Lower Mississippi Delta Region states whose fastidious work provided the high-quality data for my dissertation. Thank you, James Whitacre, for your technical assistance with the network analyst in ARCGIS and to Steve Scaife for being a SAS sounding board for me. I would like to thank all of my friends and colleagues at the Office of Population Science and Policy and the Center for Clinical Research at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine who were exceedingly patient, gracious, and supportive throughout my doctoral journey. I am particularly appreciative of Amanda Fogleman, Georgia Mueller-Luckey, Dr.
