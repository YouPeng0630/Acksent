I’m very grateful for the opportunities that have been given to me and the support which has enabled me to realize my potential. My parents have always motivated me and encouraged me to always ask questions and look for answers. I would like to especially thank my advisor Professor Zhi-Pei Liang for all of the time and energy he has taken to give me the support, advice and direction I needed to make it to this point. I’m especially grateful for the kind but candid mentoring that has helped me to grow. Early on, Zhi-Pei made it clear that his ultimate goal was to provide me with a learning experience that would be a positive influence in my career development, and he has stayed true to this goal. I am very grateful to Professor Brad Sutton for lending me the computa- tional as well as human resources needed to take on this large-scale learning task. I also appreciate all my labmates who have selflessly given time to help me whenever I was in need. Special thanks to Steve Peng, Yang Chen, Brian Clifford, Ronny Guo and Yudu Li. Each of them went to great lengths to help me with data acquisition and preparation, comparative experiments, software setup and anything else I needed. Finally, I would like to thank my loving wife Katelyn for following me across the country to Champaign, IL and agreeing to start our family here in our new home. I couldn’t have done any of this without her.
