This project would not have been possible without the support of many people. Many thanks to my advisor, JoÂ´zsef Balogh, who read my numerous revisions and helped make some sense of the confusion. Also thanks to my committee members, Alexandr V. Kostochka, Anush Tserunyan, and Mikhail Lavrov, who offered guidance and support. And finally, thanks to my parents and numerous friends who endured this long process with me, always offering support and love.
