It gives me immense pleasure in expressing my sincere gratitude to all those people who have supported me and had made invaluable contributions in making this thesis possible. First, I would like to profusely thank my research advisor Dr. Tonghun Lee for his continuous guidance, support, motivation, patience and untiring help throughout my graduate studies. I consider myself very fortunate to have worked under him. One simply could not wish for a better or friendlier adviser and he has been a great mentor to me all these years. He has taught me how to critically examine my results before coming to any new conclusions. Every discussion I have had with him was a new learning experience for me. Also, he has shown the utmost patience when dealing with my mistakes, no matter how big, and has always looked to guide me forward. I look forward to future encounters and am forever indebted for all the kindness you have shown.
