This work would not have been possible without the people who have helped and influenced me significantly in the past five years. I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, Professor Dan Work, for all the support along the way. I am greatly indebted to the days when we worked together to go through line-by-line the early versions of the proof on estimator performance in traffic monitoring, fought together to address all of the hard reviews in my first journal submission, and attended various conferences and workshops together in all parts of the world. He gave me the courage to pursue what I thought was impossible and the spirit to seek for perfectionism, which have been constant motivations for me during my PhD, and beyond. I would also like to thank Dr. Sebastien Blandin, my supervisor at IBM Research, who guided my exploration in many fascinating areas of data analytic and estimation, e.g., sensor scheduling, differential privacy, inference in graphical models, etc. I am extremely fortunate to work with him on the mathematically challenging problems, to experience the purest beauty of research, in the amazing city of Singapore. I am greatly honored to have Professor Geir Dullerud, Professor Yanfeng Ouyang, and Professor Richard Sowers in my doctoral committee. Professor Dullerud has been a great mentor since six years ago when I interned at his lab as a visiting undergraduate student. The book he wrote on robust control theory, which he gave me as a gift when I finished the internship, inspired my curiosity and enthusiasm in control / estimation theory. His course in convex control, which I completed after I came back to Illinois as a PhD student, has become a core supporting resource for my research. Professor Ouyang introduced me to the areas of logistic system and car-following model, which significantly broadened my horizon in the field of transportation. As my academic elder brother from Tsinghua, his diligence,
