Several people contributed greatly to my success during the past few years, and to them I am indebted. To my mother and stepfather – thank you for always believing in me even when I did not, and for being there for me in my time of need. And to Prof. Zimmerman – thank you for giving me a second chance after I recovered from my illness, and for allowing my creativity to shape this project into something quite unique.
